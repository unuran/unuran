GCC compiler options:

-ffloat-store
     Do not store floating point variables in registers, and inhibit
     other options that might change whether a floating point value is
     taken from a register or memory.


-fstack-protector
     Emit extra code to check for buffer overflows, such as stack
     smashing attacks.  This is done by adding a guard variable to
     functions with vulnerable objects.  This includes functions that
     call alloca, and functions with buffers larger than 8 bytes.  The
     guards are initialized when a function is entered and then checked
     when the function exits.  If a guard check fails, an error message
     is printed and the program exits.

-fstack-protector-all
     Like `-fstack-protector' except that all functions are protected.
