/*							mtherr.c
 *
 *	Library common error handling routine
 *
 *
 *
 * SYNOPSIS:
 *
 * char *fctnam;
 * int code;
 * int mtherr();
 *
 * mtherr( fctnam, code );
 *
 *
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *
 * This routine may be called to report one of the following
 * error conditions (in the include file mconf.h).
 *  
 *   Mnemonic        Value          Significance
 *
 *    DOMAIN            1       argument domain error
 *    SING              2       function singularity
 *    OVERFLOW          3       overflow range error
 *    UNDERFLOW         4       underflow range error
 *
 * The default version of the file prints the function name,
 * passed to it by the pointer fctnam, followed by the
 * error condition.  The display is directed to the standard
 * output device.  The routine then returns to the calling
 * program.  Users may wish to modify the program to abort by
 * calling exit() under severe error conditions such as domain
 * errors.
 *
 * Since all error conditions pass control to this function,
 * the display may be easily changed, eliminated, or directed
 * to an error logging device.
 *
 * SEE ALSO:
 *
 * mconf.h
