Type `make check' in this directory to run a test suite.

It tests whether the library recognizes invalid input and validates
the various routines.


`+'    test successful  (ok)
`0'    expected init to failed  (ok)
`-'    expected init or run test to fail  (ok)

`?'    test failed, try again

`(~x)' test failed for less than 1 %  (tolerated --> ok)

`(!+)' test failed  (error)
`(!0)' init did not fail as expected  (error)
`(!-)' test did not fail as expected  (error)

`='    test has been executed, result printed into log file

`.'    test not executed
`X'    could not run test, data missing

--------------------------------------------------

There are two test modi: 'installation' and 'fullcheck'.
The additional tests for the 'fullcheck' are only run when
the environment variable 'UNURANFULLCHECK' is defined (regardless 
of the actual value of the variable). 

You can use `make fullcheck' to run all tests in 
'fullcheck' mode.

--------------------------------------------------

It is possible to measure the elapsed times for each of the tests
by defining the environment variable 'UNURANSTOPWATCH'.

--------------------------------------------------

The seed used for all the tests can be changed at runtime by
setting the environmental variable 'SEED' with a none-zero
unsigned integer.

--------------------------------------------------

To test CDF, PDF, etc. of distributions type

make data
make run_test_with_Mathematica
./run_test_with_Mathematica

Detailed results are written into 
t_Mathematica_test.log.

This test requires Mathematica 4.0.
(The test fails for version 3.0)
