Version 0.6.0: ???? 200?

	- adding multivariate Cauchy and Student distributions.

	- new method NORTA (NORmal To Anything)

	- new method HITROU  

	- new flexible interface to uniform random number generators.
	  No compiler switches necessary. Thus it is now possible to
	  use random numbers from different libraries without 
	  recompiling UNURAN.

	- The generic interface to uniform random number generators
          has been enhanced. However it cannot be accessed directly any more.
          Use the corresponding calls instead (see also the message above). 

	- continuous distribution objects have a slot for the center
	  of the distribution. It is now set for the distribution
	  directly. This mechanism replaces the _set_ calls for 
	  all methods that make use of the center.

        - interface for setting and getting parameter-arrays for 
          multivariate distributions has been renamed.

        - method MCORR is extended to cover generation of random
	  correlation matrices with given eigenvalues.

Version 0.5.0: August 2004

	- UNU.RAN now makes use of IEEE 754 compliant floating point
	  arithmetic. In particular, 1./0. and 0./0. must result in 
	  infinity and NaN (not a number), respectively, and must not
	  cause a floating point exception.
	  For all modern compting architecture this is implemented in
	  hardware or in software using a special compiler flag.

	- new methods NROU and VNROU

	- new method MCORR
	
	- return codes of _set_ and _get_ functions have been changed:
	  in case of successful execution 0 (or UNUR_SUCCESS) is returned 
	  (instead of 1 in previous versions). 
	  Thus it is possible to return some non-zero error code in case 
	  of an failure.

	- the API of method VMT has changed

	- added new disribution type MATR for matrix distributions.
	  (Currently only used for creating random covariance matrices)

	- multivariate distribution objects now contain marginal distributions.

	- unur_distr_cvec_set_covar() now checks for positive definiteness of
	  given covariance matrix.

	- fixed bug in function that (automatically) computes a 
	  probability vector by means of the probability mass
	  function. This caused methods that require explicitly given
	  probability vectors (like DAU) to truncate the last entry.

	- some other minor bug fixes

Version 0.4.5: July 2003

	- added method DSS (discrete sequential search)

	- added rerandomized ARS to method AROU

	- bug fixes with discrete distributions

Version 0.4.4: July 2003

	- "orderstatistics" need not be last entry in string API

	- replaced unur_tabl_set_variant_setup() by unur_tabl_set_usedars()
          with a slightly different interface.

Version 0.4.3: June 2003

	- fixed problem with prepocessor for MacOS X

	- fixed bug in Kinderman-Ramage Gaussian variate generator

Version 0.4.2: March 2003

	- new interface for unur_tdr_eval_invcdfhat()

	- fixed bug in error handling of method AROU

Version 0.4.1: January 2003

	- use build-in generator as default uniform random number generator

	- string API: fixed bug with string 'inf' in cygwin.
	              parsing of numbers does not depend on locale any more

	- fixed bug in Makefile

Version 0.4.0: January 2003
	
	- added methods HRB, HRD, and HRI for distributions with given
	  hazard rates (bounded, decreasing, and increasing, resp.)

	- added method EMPL (empirical CDF with linear interpolation)
	  (for sake of completeness; method not recommended)

	- support for shared libraries

	- reorganization of source tree

	- bug fixes

Version 0.3.0: October 2002

	- added method HINV (Hermite interpolation based INVersion of CDF)

	- new interface for using uniform random number generators;
	  all settings are now in ./src/unuran_config.h

	- added support for more uniform random number generator packages

	- included better build-in uniform pseudo-random number generator

	- added unur_gen_clone() call

	- added const qualifier in function prototypes where appropriate

	- fixed broken computation of window width in method EMPK

	- many bug fixes

Version 0.2.0: June 2002

	- added new simple API (String interface)

	- added method AUTO (automatic)

	- added method DSROU (discrete simple ratio of uniforms)

	- improved method for finding construction points in methods TDR and AROU
	  (Derandomized adaptive rejection sampling)

	- many bug fixes

Version 0.1.0: March 2001

        - First public release.
