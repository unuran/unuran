Version 0.5.0: ???? 2004

	- return codes of _set_ and _get_ functions have been changed:
	  in case of successful execution 0 (or UNUR_SUCCESS) is returned 
	  (instead of 1 in previous versions). 
	  Thus it is possible to return some non-zero error code in case 
	  of an failure.

	- added new disribution type CMAT for continuous matrix distributions.
	  (Currently only used for creating random covariance matrices)

	- multivariate distribution objects s now contain marginal distributions.

	- unur_distr_cvec_set_covar() now checks for positive definiteness of
	  given covariance matrix.

	- some other minor bug fixes

Version 0.4.5: July 2003

	- added method DSS (discrete sequential search)

	- added rerandomized ARS to method AROU

	- bug fixes with discrete distributions

Version 0.4.4: July 2003

	- "orderstatistics" need not be last entry in string API

	- replaced unur_tabl_set_variant_setup() by unur_tabl_set_usedars()
          with a slightly different interface.

Version 0.4.3: June 2003

	- fixed problem with prepocessor for MacOS X

	- fixed bug in Kinderman-Ramage Gaussian variate generator

Version 0.4.2: March 2003

	- new interface for unur_tdr_eval_invcdfhat()

	- fixed bug in error handling of method AROU

Version 0.4.1: January 2003

	- use build-in generator as default uniform random number generator

	- string API: fixed bug with string 'inf' in cygwin.
	              parsing of numbers does not depend on locale any more

	- fixed bug in Makefile

Version 0.4.0: January 2003
	
	- added methods HRB, HRD, and HRI for distributions with given
	  hazard rates (bounded, decreasing, and increasing, resp.)

	- added method EMPL (empirical CDF with linear interpolation)
	  (for sake of completeness; method not recommended)

	- support for shared libraries

	- reorganization of source tree

	- bug fixes

Version 0.3.0: October 2002

	- added method HINV (Hermite interpolation based INVersion of CDF)

	- new interface for using uniform random number generators;
	  all settings are now in ./src/unuran_config.h

	- added support for more uniform random number generator packages

	- included better build-in uniform pseudo-random number generator

	- added unur_gen_clone() call

	- added const qualifier in function prototypes where appropriate

	- fixed broken computation of window width in method EMPK

	- many bug fixes

Version 0.2.0: June 2002

	- added new simple API (String interface)

	- added method AUTO (automatic)

	- added method DSROU (discrete simple ratio of uniforms)

	- improved method for finding construction points in methods TDR and AROU
	  (Derandomized adaptive rejection sampling)

	- many bug fixes

Version 0.1.0: March 2001

        - First public release.
