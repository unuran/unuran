UNU.RAN  is an ANSI-C library licensed under GPL. 
It contains universal (also called automatic or black-box) algorithms that can
generate random numbers from large classes of continuous or discrete 
distributions. 

The library and an extensive online documentation are available at:
          -------------------------------------------
             http://statistik.wu-wien.ac.at/unuran/ 
          -------------------------------------------



---------------------------------------------------------
A short overview
---------------------------------------------------------

To generate random numbers the user must supply some information
about the desired distribution, especially a C-function that computes the
density and - depending on the chosen methods - some additional information 
(like the borders of the domain, the mode, the derivative of the density ...).
After a user has given this information an init-program computes all tables
and constants necessary for the random variate generation. The sample program 
can then generate variates from the desired distribution. 

The main part 
of UNURAN are different universal algorithms (called methods).
 There are:
  7 methods for continuous univariate distributions
  3 methods for discrete univariate distributions
  1 method for univariate empirical distributions (given by an observed sample)
  1 method for multivariate empirical distributions (given by a vector sample)

The choice of the method depends on the information available for the 
distribution and on the desired charateristics of the algorithm 
(fast initialisation and slow sampling, slow initialisation and fast sampling).

A second important part
of UNURAN is the distribution module containing all necessary functions for 
many continuous and discrete univariate standard distributions. 
Thus UNURAN can be used  without extra coding to obtain very fast 
generators for the best known standard distributions. 

Although coded in ANSI-C UNURAN uses an object oriented user interface relying
on: 
  distribution objects (containing all information of the distribution)
  parameter objects (containing all input parameters (and defaults) for the
                     different methods)
  generator object (produced by the initialization program, containing
                    everything necessary for sampling)


Of course a uniform random number generator is necessary to use UNURAN. We 
provide an interface to use the PRNG uniform package from the University
of Salzburg (Austria), available at http://statistik.wu-wien.ac.at/prng/
or http://random.mat.ac.at .
It is also no problem to include any other uniform random number generators.

ADVANTAGES OF UNUNRAN
---------------------------------------------------------
Why can it be worth the to download UNURAN and to understand the concept
 of the interface? 
Isn't it much faster to implement a simple standard method for the 
distribution I am interested in?

The first and main advantage lies in the modelling flexibility you gain for 
for simulation. Once you have installed UNURAN you can generate without
 coding more than the desired density function from 
practically all uni-modal distributions. For a really big number of standard
distributions (and truncated versions of these standard distributions) you 
need not even code the density, as it is included in UNURAN.
The library consists many extreme robust and fast generation algorithms 
which were developed during the last ten years.
Their speed is only slightly influencedby the chosen distribution.

Nevertheless Correlation induction facilities are included!
