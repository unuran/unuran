(*) Simple Markups and TAGs
    =======================

Great parts of the UNURAN User Manual are generated automatically from
the library header files by means of the make_texi.pl script.

Thus all files in the unuran tree that end in .h or .dh are scanned.
(Files ending in .dh are files header files that only contains
documentation.)

Simple markups (TAGs) are used to indicate relevant parts.
A TAG has the regular expression  /^\s+=[A-Z]+/, i.e. `=' followed by
some capital letters.
(C comment strings `/*' are ignored.)

The body of the documentation uses texinfo with some additional macros
(see below).



(*) Nodes
    =====

Nodes start with a node TAG and contain everything until the next 
=EON TAG (`End-Of-Node') or end of file.

Valid node TAGs are

	=TOP		for the top node
	=DISTR          for handling distribution objects
	=METHOD         for generation methods
	=APPENDIX       for nodes in the appendix
	=NODE           generic node

A header file that has no such TAG or with a different first TAG is
ignored and not included into the documentation.

Node TAGs must have two arguments:
The first word is the name of the node and must be unique in the
entire documentation.
The remaining part of the line is treated as the node title,
used for the texinfo sectioning commands.

(*) Section TAGs
    ============

TAGs are used to scan the node and partition it into sections. A
node section starts with a TAG and ends with the line before the next
TAG (or end of file). It depends on the TAG how the read text is
processed further.

The following TAGs are valid:

=END 	The corresponding node section is simply ignored. Thus it can
	be used as end markup of a subsection (thus its name).

=UP	Required!
	the first word is the super node, i.e. the node to which it is
	a subnode. 
	It might be followed (optionally) by anything with the regular
	expression /\[\w+\]/, e.g. [14a].
	It is used to sort subnodes (lexicographically ordering of the
	string between the brachets is used).
	If it is omitted the node name is used instead.

=REQUIRED	List of required parameters.
	Contains a list of parameter that are required for the method.

=OPTIONAL	List of optional parameters.
	Contains a list of parameters that are optional for the
	method.

=SPEED  Generation speed of generator method.

=SEEALSO	Similar methods.
	List of methods that work similar as this method.	
	(not implemented yet)

=ABSTRACT	Abstract.
	A very short description of method. Used in an overview.
	(not implemented yet)

=REF	References for method or distribution.
	Each reference has to be enclosed in square brackets 
	"[ ... ]". More than one reference can given; but then only 
	white space characters are allowed to separate them.
	The format for the entries within the square brackets 
	is the same as for the @unurbibref macro (see below).

=PDF    PDF of distribution.

=PMF    PMF of distribution.

=CONST  Area below PDF or sum over PMF.

=DOMAIN	Domain of PDF or PMF.

=FPARAM	List of parameters of distribution.
	Parameters must be given in the correct ordering.
	Every line contains a parameter.
	It is described by 5 fields which terminated by a colon `:'.
	Eg:
	    0    : alpha : > 0 :   : shape    :
           [1]   : beta  : > 0 : 1 : scale    :
	  [[2]]  : gamma :     : 0 : location :
	
	The first field is the number of the parameter. Square brackets
	are used to indicate optional parameters. In this example
	alpha is required. Alternative alpha and beta 
	or alpha, beta and gamma can be provided.

	The second field is the name of the parameter as it is
	used in the =PDF, =CONSTANT and =DOMAIN subsections.
	
	The third field gives condition for the range of valid parameters.

	The forth field gives the default value for optional parameters,
	that are used when these are omitted.

	The last field is a short description of the parameter.

=STDGEN List of special generator for (UNURAN) standard distributions.
	Each special generator must be given in one line.
	The first entry is the identy for the special generator as given for
	the unur_cstd_set_variant() and unur_dstd_set_variant() call.
	Use DEF and INV as abbreviations for UNUR_STDGEN_DEFAULT and
	UNUR_STDGEN_INVERSION, respectively. References must be given
	in square brackets [...] as the last entry. Anything after the
	references is ignored.
	
=DESCRIPTION	Discription of method. Can be used to print any text.

=ROUTINES	Function reference.
	List of all subroutines.
	The text is formated in the following way:

	lines starting with `#' are ignored.

	The text consists of blocks which are separated by one or more
	blank lines outside of C comments (everything within a C
	comment is treated as a single line).
	In particular blocks end at a `*/' followed by an empty line.

	IMPORTANT:
	A function with no description should be immediately followed
	by `/* */' (on the next line).

	All C comment markers `/*' and `*/' are removed.

	A block that started with a C type declaration is treated as a
	function prototype. Anything below the `;' till the end of the
	block is interpreted as the function description.

	An anchor will be made for each function using the key:
	funct.<fn_name>, 
	e.g. `funct.unur_set_urng' for function unur_set_urng.

	If there is a function prototype with additional lines, it is
	assumed that it has the same description as the following
	function. (This is done recursively until a function prototype
	with description is found.)

	A "function prototype" without any arguments (with or without 
	braces `( )' )is treated as a variable.

	A block that starts with a `==DOC' is copied verbatim into the
	texi file. (Notice that `==DOC' is not a TAG as described
	above).



(*) Common Transformation Rules
    ===========================

To avoid spoiling the header file with to many texinfo tags, the following
transformations are made during file procession:

NULL        --> @code{NULL}
TRUE        --> @code{TRUE}
FALSE       --> @code{FALSE}

(\w+)\(\)   --> @command($1)
		eg.: unur_set_urng()  --> @command{unur_set_urng}.
		additionally hyperlinks are made automatically to
		its definition in HTML output
		(and in TeX and info with some restrictions).
		NOTICE: there must not be blanks between the 
		function name and `(' or the braces!

to insert C comment sign into a header file use
@cc_start   -->   /*
@cc_stop    -->   */


(*) Special Bibtex Macros
    =====================

There are a few additional texinfo macros. These start with @unur
and are expanded by the make_texi.pl script and not passed directly to
makeinfo. 

@unurbibref	makes a reference to a book or journal listed in
	references.dh. It only contains one such reference. If more
	references are necessary then a series of such macros is
	needed. The entry must be the corresponding anchor in the
	reference.dh file. (The format in this file should be clear
	from the other entries that already exist.)
	Additional remarks, like "Sect.5" or "p.234" can follow but
	must be separated by a colon ":". You are not allowed to use a
	curly bracket "{" or "}". A comma "," is automatically
	replaced by a semicolon. 
	(This restrictions are due to texinfo).
