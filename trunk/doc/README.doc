(*) Simple Markups and TAGs
    =======================+

Great parts of the UNURAN User Manual are generated automatically from
the library header files.

Simple markups (TAGs) are used to indicate relevant parts.
A TAG has the regular expression  /^\s+=[A-Z]+/, i.e. a `=' as the
first character on a line followed by some capital letters.
(C comment strings `/*' are ignored.)


(*) Section TAGs
    ============

The very first TAG in a header file must be a section TAG. Valid
section TAGs are

   =DISTRIBUTION     for handling distribution objects
   =ERROR            for error handling and debuging
   =METHOD           for generation methods
   =URNG             for uniform random number generators


A header file that has no such TAG or with a different first TAG is
ignored and not included into the documentation.

Section TAGs may have arguments.

All other TAGs do not have arguments, i.e. anything from the TAG till
the end of line is ignored.

TAGs are used to scan the header file and partition it into
subsections. A subsection starts with a TAG and ends with the
line before the next TAG (or end of file). It depends on the TAG how
the read text is processed further.

The list of valid TAGs depends on the section TAG in the file.
Some TAGs are required, others are optional.

However the =END TAG is common to all sections. The corresponding
subsection is simply ignored. Thus it can be used as end markup of a
subsection (thus its name).

(*) common transformation rules
    ---------------------------

To avoid spoiling the header file with to many texinfo tags, the following
transformations are made during file procession:

NULL        --> @code{NULL}
TRUE        --> @code{TRUE}
FALSE       --> @code{FALSE}

(\w+)\(\)   --> @command($1)
		eg.: unur_set_urng()  --> @command{unur_set_urng}.
		additionally hyperlinks are made automatically to
		its definition in HTML output
		(and in TeX and info with some restrictions).


(*) =METHOD
    -------

Describes a method for generating random numbers (generator object).

The section TAG has two arguments:
  [1] The first word is the abbreviation of the method.
  [2] Anything followed by the first word is the (long) name of the method.

The following TAGs are valid:

   =TYPE        (required)	Type of distribution. 
	The first word indicates the type of distribution for which
	the method works. Only such distribution types that have a
	corresponding entry in the a =DISTRIBUTION section are
	allowed. All other entries are ignored.

   =REQUIRED    (optional)	List of required parameters.
	Contains a list of parameter that are required for the method.
	(not implemented yet)

   =OPTIONAL    (optional)	List of optional parameters.
	Contains a list of parameters that are optional for the
	method.
	(not implemented yet)

   =SEEALSO     (optional)	Similar methods.
	List of methods that work similar as this method.	
	(not implemented yet)

   =ABSTRACT    (optional)	Abstract.
	A very short description of method. Used in an overview.
	(not implemented yet)

   =DESCRIPTION (required)	Description.
	Discription of method.

   =ROUTINES    (required)	Function reference.
	List of all subroutines.
	The text is formated in the following way:

	lines starting with `#' are ignored.

	The text consists of blocks which are separated by one or more
	blank lines outside of C comments (everything within a C
	comment is treated as a single line).
	In particular blocks end at a `*/' followed by an empty line.

	IMPORTANT:
	A function with no description should be immediately followed
	by `/* */' (on the next line).

	All C comment markers `/*' and `*/' are removed.

	A block that started with a C type declaration is treated as a
	function prototype. Anything below the `;' till the end of the
	block is interpreted as the function description.

	An anchor will be made for each function using the key:
	funct.<fn_name>, 
	e.g. `funct.unur_set_urng' for function unur_set_urng.

	If there is a function prototype with additional lines, it is
	assumed that it has the same description as the following
	function. (This is done recursively until a function prototype
	with description is found.)

	A "function prototype" without any arguments (with or without 
	braces `( )' )is treated as a variable.

	A block that starts with a `==DOC' is copied verbatim into the
	texi file. (Notice that `==DOC' is not a TAG as described
	above).


(*) =DISTRIBUTION
    -------------

Describes how to handle distribution objects.

The section TAG has two arguments:
   [1]  The first word is the abbreviation of the distribution type.
	Only these types are allowed as in the =TYPE subsection of
	methods.
 
   [2]  The second entry must be \[\d+\], e.g. [14].
	It is used to sort the subsections in output.

   [3]  Anything following the first word is the (long) name of the
	distribution type.

The following TAGs are valid:

   =ROUTINES    (required)	Function reference.
	See section =METHOD.
   

(*) =ERROR
    ------

Describes how to handle errors and debuging.

The section TAG has two arguments:
   [1]  The first word is an abbreviation for the section.
 
   [2]  Anything following the first word is the section title

The following TAGs are valid:

   =ROUTINES    (required)	Function reference.
	See section =METHOD.
   

(*) =URNG
    -----

Describes how to use uniform random number generators.

The section TAG has two arguments:
   [1]  The first word _must_ be `URNG'
 
   [2]  Anything following `URNG' is the section title

The following TAGs are valid:

   =ROUTINES    (required)	Function reference.
	See section =METHOD.
