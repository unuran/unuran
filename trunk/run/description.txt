String Interface for Standard Distributions

The easiest way to use UNURAN with standard distributions
is to use its string interface.
The command `unur_str2gen' takes a single string with information
about the desired standard distribution and optional about the
generation method and even the uniform random generator and it returns
a pointer to a generator object. Be aware that using the string interface
is only possible with implemented standard distributions and many other
features of UNRAN can't get accessed when using it. In exchange it is
easier to use because more of the implementation of UNURAN is hidden.
For trickier tasks it will be necessary to go deeper in the Concepts of
UNURAN.

The string interface:
As mentioned the string holds information about the standard distribution
to sample from and (optional) about the sampling method and the
uniform random number generator invoked.
Therefore the the string consists of up to three block which must be
separated with a colon `:'. The standard distribution block must be first!
Here an example to illustrate that, the details will be explained below:
unur_str2gen("distr=normal(0,1) : method=arou; max_sqhratio=0.9 : prng=MT19937(133)")

Within each block a piece of information must be provided using
a <key>=<value> scheme. 
If more then one piece of information is needed, 
the <key>=<value> pairs must be separeted with semicolons `;'.
The <key> is a keyword explained below.
The value can be a string, a number or a list of numbers or a string
followed by a list of numbers (examples will be given below),
depending on the <key>. A list must be  bounded with parentheses
`(' and `)' and the list separator is a komma `,'.
If the value is a string and a list in beetween only white space
is allowed.


Distribution:
The key `distr' is obligatory, it must be first and the corresponding
value must be one  of the implemented standard distributions---with
a list of parameters.
e.g.: distr=normal(0,1)
See the list of standard distributions which parameters must be provided.
Furthermore it's possible to set the domain via the key `domain'.

Method:
Use this block only if you want to invoke a specific method
impemented in UNURAN. If this block is omitted, UNURAN chooses
a suitable method.
The key `method' is obligatory, it must be first and the value must be the
name of a method suitable for the choosen standard distribution.
e.g.: method=arou
Of course the following keys dependend on the method choosen at first.
All corresponding `_set_' commands of UNURAN are available and the key
is the string after the `unur_<methodname>_set_' part of the command.
e.g.: UNURAN provides the command `unur_arou_set_max_sqhratio' to
set a parameter of the method AROU.
To call this function via the string-interface, the
key `max_sqhratio' can be used:
max_sqhratio=0.9


Uniform random number generator:
Use this block only if you are familiar with the PRNG package.
If this block is omitted, UNURAN chooses a uniform random number generator.
The only key allowed is `prng' and the following value is a
string which is passed as it is to the PRNG package
E.g. prng=MT19937(133)
invokes the Mersenne Twisester with the seed 133.
For more information see the PRNG manual.
